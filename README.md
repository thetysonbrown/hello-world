...baby steps in development

This is my formal foray into web development. I caught the coding bug when I needed to build a site for work.  With a little help from a co-worker and the web, I have a full functioning site that is being used by almost 100 people.  There is so much more I'd like to do with the site, so I thought now is the time to really get an education in web development.  There are also times I find myself wishing I was able to build what I see friends developiing (apps, useful tools, etc).  I have lots of ideas for solutions that require web and app development.  Now is the time to learn and start doing!

I also need to find a cooler username.
